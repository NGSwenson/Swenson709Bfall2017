Post-Hurricane Dynamics of Tropical Tree Functional Diversity
=============================================================

This code generates 50 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a s.d. of 1.

```{r }

rand.vals = rnorm(50)

```

Here we plot a histogram of the 50 random numbers.

```{r }

hist(rand.vals, col="red")

```
